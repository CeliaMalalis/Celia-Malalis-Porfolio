        <p>I am Celia Fe Malalis, I am 19 years old and my birthday is on <a href="../public/My Birthday.html">March 10, 2006</a><br/>
        and I live in Ipil heights, Ipil , Zamboanga Sibugay. I am a daughter of Karla Fe and Efren Malalis and I have 4 siblings Bona, Efrela,<br/>
        Albert, and Carl. I am the third child among my siblings. When I was young, I used to be with my family, and we are a complete family <br/>
        but when my mother passed away when I was 13 years old, things changed and I feel sad but my father took care of me, and until now he <br/>
        is my idol because he how to be independent person as a single father<br/><br/>
        
        My hobbies are playing badminton beacuse it makes my body active and I love also listening music because it makes me relax especially while <br/>
        washing the dishes and studying. I also love playing my phone all the time because it makes me relax not just relax but it can also helped me <br/>
        connect to people from afar and it also helps me to update the weather for tommorow <br/><br/>
        
        In my elementary years from kinder to grade 5 I studied from Marian College but in grade 6, I was transferred <br/>
        to Ipil Heights Elementary due to financial issues. In my highshool years I studied in Marcelo Spinola School and I was a scholar, and I'm <br/>
        really thankful that the arcelo Spinola sisters and the benefactors gave me a opportunity to study. They helped me learn and grow despite <br/>
        my family's financial stuggles. Now I'm currently studying at WMSU ESU IPIL, and I hope that I can achieve my dreams and be able to help other <br/> 
        people, just like how the Marcelo Spinola sisters did to me. I am thankful for everything I went through because it inspire me to become a person  <br/>
        who helps others in need.
